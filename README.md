# Project Info
For the Data Science portion of this application, we used this Kaggle Medi-Cabinet Dataset. We used data from the Kaggle Cannabis Competition to cluster 5 categories from the description of each strain. We used K-Means Clustering to create the 5 categories. Next we pickled a vectorizer and KNN model to create an API that output the top 5 recommendations.
